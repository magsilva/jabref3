?:
 - Added property ReferenceHeaderParagraphFormat in style file to control the paragraph
   format of the bibliography header.
 - Fixed bug in handling of von particles in citation markers.

0.1:
 - Added functionality to choose which Writer document to connect to - selector is shown both
   when connecting, and when using the new "Select Writer document" button.
 - Improved appearance of the OpenOffice panel.
 - A space is now inserted after newly inserted citations, in order to alleviate problem
   with new text becoming part of the citation marker.
 - Some improvements to cursor placement after inserting citation.

0.0.9 (2008-10-19):
 - Streamlined connection process by adding button that attempts to find the necessary
   paths automatically.

0.0.8 (2008-09-03):
 - No changes, but packaged with JabRef 2.4.

0.0.7 (2008-02-20):
 - Added interface for selecting style. You can set up a list of single files and directories
   that will be scanned to build a list of styles (directories can be scanned recursively).
 - Fixed problem with layouts starting with a tag such as "<b>" would disable bold/italics
   formatting for the entire entry.

   for the reference list (default value is "Default").

0.0.6 (2008-02-12):
 - "Test" button in this version autocombines citations that are separated by spaces only.

   now included in the citations.

0.0.3 (2007-12-22):
 - Reworked the entire plugin to bypass OpenOffice.org's built-in bibliography functions.
   This makes it possible to solve the open issues in previous versions, and add support
   for multiple citations, and uniquefier letters and formatting within fields in the
   bibliography.
 - The bibliography is now formatted using standard JabRef layout, including formatters.
 - A new formatter FormatChars is added, which translates LaTeX commands for bold and italic
   into the <b> and <i> markup used by this plugin. This lets the formatting carry into
   the bibliography in OO where appropriate.

 - Fixed bug that prevented the "editor" field from being exported.
 - Missing fields are now populated from crossreferenced entry where available.
