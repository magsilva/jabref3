0.8.99 (beta):
 - Added function for citing with extra information such as page numbers, which is appended
   at the end of the citation marker (inside the end bracket).
 - Added citation manager that shows list of the citations in the current document in context,
   and allows editing of extra information for each.
 - Formatting of citation markers is changed - it now allows the user to specify a character
   format (with the citation property 'CitationCharacterFormat') which can be defined in
   OpenOffice with any formatting. The character format will only be applied if the property
   'FormatCitations' is true. The old citation formatting properties are obsoleted.
 - Text used in author-year citations is now run through the formatter that handles LaTeX
   special characters.
 - Style files can now have either Unix or Dos/Windows line breaks. 
0.8:
 - Added some explanatory text to style selection dialog.
 - Added context menu for style list that allows quickly opening a style file in an external
   editor.
 - Introduced optional double quotes for style file properties.
 - Removed extra space between number marker and rest of citation in numbered reference
   list.
 - Fixed bug: update crash caused by reference marks not related to JabRef. 
0.7.4:
 - Added optional citation property "AuthorLastSeparatorInText" which, if present,
   overrides "AuthorLastSeparator" for in-text author-year citations.
 - Added citation property "MultiCiteChronological". For author-year citations, this
   property can be set to false instead of true to get alphabetical sorting of entries
   within the same citation.
 - Fixed bug: for normal characters, CharEscapementHeight was set to 0 instead of 100.
0.7.3:
 - Changed order of formatting operations in order to fix the problem that formatting
   of the first part of a reference list entry gets lost.
 - Added <smallcaps> tag to indicate small caps in reference list.
 - Modified parsing of style file so boolean properties can be parsed even if extra
   white space is included, e.g. "true ".
 - Fixed bug in "MaxAuthorsFirst" handling: if two citations can be grouped, but one of
   them has appeared earlier, this should prevent grouping if the difference between
   "MaxAuthorsFirst" and "MaxAuthors" has bearing on the citations in question.
0.7.2:
 - Added option "MaxAuthorsFirst" to control how many authors can be shown the first
   time a citation appears before "et al" is used. "MaxAuthors" controls the following
   appearances.
0.7.1:
 - The preformatter is now preferentially run after instead of before formatters called
   from the layout specification. This solves the problems of e.g. organization author
   names wrapped in braces (e.g. {World Bank}), where the braces have no effect as long
   as the preprocessor is run first. This feature depends on a change introduced in
   JabRef 2.6, and if older versions are used, the preprocessor will be run first as before.
 - Fixed problem with repeated citations in numbered citations.
 - Fixed problem with paragraph format not affecting the entire bibliography entries.
0.7:
 - All BibTeX fields are now run through a formatter that translates LaTeX character
   sequences and \textit{} and \textbf{} commands before insertion into OO. 
0.6:
 - Improved behaviour when the document references BibTeX keys not found in the
   BibTeX database. Citation is now marked as undefined, and the remaining
   bibliography gets created as normal.
 - Added settings popup menu, and option for whether to automatically sync
   bibliography when inserting new citations.
0.5:
 - Fixed bug in Merge citations feature - citations would be lost when combined
   citations have same year.
 - Fixed problem with connection on Mac.
0.4:
 - Added optional citation properties BracketBeforeInList and BracketAfterInList that override
   BracketBefore and BracketAfter for the numbering of the reference list.
 - Added support for <sup> and <sub> tags in reference layouts, for superscript and
   subscript, respectively.
 - Added "SubscriptCitations" property that gives subscripted citation markers.
0.3:
 - Some changes to the interface.
 - Added property MinimumGroupingCount the determines how many consecutive numbers are
   required for grouping in a citation marker (e.g. [1-3] or[2;5-8]).
 - Fixed bug in properties parsing - empty strings are no longer ignored and replaced by
   default values.
0.2.1:
 - Fixed bug in sorting of reference list.
0.2:
 - Citation markers are now set to language [None] to prevent spell checker from underlining
   names.
 - Fixed sorting of citations in table cells and footnotes.
 - Added option for superscripted citation markers.
0.1.9:
 - Added support for citations in table cells and footnotes. Currently sorting by position
   fails if there are such citations.
 - Added properties for setting bold/italic formatting on citation markers.
0.1.2:
 - Added button for inserting invisible citations (without text in the citation marker),
   which can be used to insert an entry into the reference list without citing it.
 - When citations are merged, they are now sorted chronologically (oldest first).
0.1.1:
 - It is now possible to connect again after OpenOffice has been shut down and started
   again.
 - Added property ReferenceHeaderParagraphFormat in style file to control the paragraph
   format of the bibliography header.
 - Added error message for the case that OpenOffice has been shut down after connection.
 - Fixed bug in handling of von particles in citation markers.
0.1:
 - Added functionality to choose which Writer document to connect to - selector is shown 
   both when connecting, and when using the new "Select Writer document" button.
 - Improved appearance of the OpenOffice panel.
 - A space is now inserted after newly inserted citations, in order to alleviate problem
   with new text becoming part of the citation marker.
 - Some improvements to cursor placement after inserting citation.

0.0.9 (2008-10-19):
 - Streamlined connection process by adding button that attempts to find the necessary
   paths automatically.
 - Made adaptations to connect to OpenOffice.org 3.x, due to changed library locations.
 - Fixed bug: plugin tries to connect even if user cancels the connect dialog.

0.0.8 (2008-09-03):
 - No changes, but packaged with JabRef 2.4.

0.0.7 (2008-02-20):
 - Added interface for selecting style. You can set up a list of single files and directories
   that will be scanned to build a list of styles (directories can be scanned recursively).
 - Fixed problem with layouts starting with a tag such as "<b>" would disable bold/italics
   formatting for the entire entry.
 - Added property "ReferenceParagraphFormat" that determines what paragraph format is used
   for the reference list (default value is "Default").

0.0.6 (2008-02-12):
 - "Test" button in this version autocombines citations that are separated by spaces only.
 - Number citation markers now give citations in ascending order (instead of chronologically,
   as with author-year citations), and group consecutive entries (e.g. [1-3; 6]). 

0.0.5 (2008-02-06):
 - Fixed bug in author-year citations with names like "Van der Waal". Von-particles are
   now included in the citations.

0.0.4 (2008-01-09):
 - When synchronizing bibliography, the style file is now automatically reloaded if it has
   been modified since the last read.
 - Cleaned out some obsolete code.

0.0.3 (2007-12-22):
 - Reworked the entire plugin to bypass OpenOffice.org's built-in bibliography functions.
   This makes it possible to solve the open issues in previous versions, and add support
   for multiple citations, and uniquefier letters and formatting within fields in the
   bibliography.
 - The bibliography is now formatted using standard JabRef layout, including formatters.
 - A new formatter FormatChars is added, which translates LaTeX commands for bold and italic
   into the <b> and <i> markup used by this plugin. This lets the formatting carry into
   the bibliography in OO where appropriate.

0.0.2 (2007-12-04):
 - Fixed bug that prevented the "editor" field from being exported.
 - Missing fields are now populated from crossreferenced entry where available.

0.0.1 (2007-12-01):
 - First version.
