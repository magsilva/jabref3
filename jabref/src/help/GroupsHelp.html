<H1>Help on using <em>Groups</em></H1>
<em>Accessed from the Groups interface in the side pane. The Groups
interface can be enabled and disabled by pressing SHIFT-CTRL-G.</em>

<p><em>Groups</em> is a feature that allows you to organize your
<em>bibtex</em> database into logical groups. Groups are very simply
implemented; once you select one or more groups, Bibkeeper checks a
single field per group (defined by the groups' definition) if it
contains the group's regular expression, and shows you either the
entries belonging to all selected groups (intersection of groups), or
the entries belonging to any of the selected groups (union of groups).

<p>The choice <em>All entries</em> will always top the group
list. Click on this choice to deselect other groups. Your selected
groups will also be deselected if you close the groups interface.

<p>Since your group definitions will be database specific, they are
saved in your .bib file. This information will be contained in a
bibtex @COMMENT block, which is ignored by the <em>bibtex</em>
program. Changing the contents of this block manually may (of course)
cause your group definitions to be lost or changed.

<H2>Different ways of using <em>groups</em></H2>

<p>Grouping might seem a little confusing at first. It is made the way
it is to ensure as much flexibility as possible:

<p>If you want your grouping to be transparent, you can define your
groups using a non-standard field name such as 'supersnill' or
anything else, and just use the <em>Add to group</em> and <em>Remove
from group</em> functions to assign entries to groups.

<p>However, if your database already has suitable keywords defined,
you might want to define some groups using the 'keywords' field, and
your database might already be grouped for you.

<p>A third option is to define some groups with ordinary fields - for
instance to define quick searches for specific authors that are
important to your work. If you do this, you should avoid using the
<em>Add to group</em> and <em>Remove from group</em> functions, since
you presumably don't want the field to get modified. You will get a
warning if you try this.

<H2>Viewing and searching in groups</H2>

<p>To view the entries in a group, click the group name. When the
groups interface has keyboard focus, you can switch between groups
using arrow keys UP and DOWN. Using SHIFT and CONTROL, you can select
several groups at the same time. The checkboxes <em>Intersection</em>
and <em>Union</em> determine how a selection of multiple groups is
handled.

<p>Note that showing a group is in fact an action similar to a
search. This means that if you add new entries to a group, you'll have
to repeat the search before the entries can be displayed as part of
the group. E.g. you need to reselect your current groups, or click the
<em>Refresh</em> button.

<p>Grouping can be combined with ordinary searches; all searches will
be restricted to the entries determined by your group selection. While
a search is active, you can switch groups or show all entries, and the
table will update to show the matches within the current group
selection.

<p>You can at any time export a <em>bibtex</em> database containing
only the entries in your currently shown groups and/or search, by
choosing <em>File -> Save special</em> in the menu.

<H2>Creating a new group</H2>

<p>To define a group, press the <em>New group</em> button in the groups
interface. A dialog will appear, where you can fill in a group name,
a regular expression, and a field name. The field name will be set to a
default value that can be changed in the <em>Preferences</em> dialog.
To finish the creation of your new group, press ENTER in one of the text
fields, or click <em>Ok</em>. To exit without creating the group, press
ESCAPE or click <em>Cancel</em>.

<H2>Modifying an existing group definition</H2>

<p>To modify an existing group definition, double-click the group name
in the groups interface, or right-click it and choose
<em>Modify</em>. The same dialog used to create new groups will
appear, allowing you to modify the group's name. The field name and
regular expression cannot be changed after the group has been created
(this restriction will probably be lifted once we get around to
implementing a method that can update the group's entries for you, to
avoid the entries falling out of the modified group).

<H2>Adding entries to a group</H2>

<p>An entry's membership in a group is decided by whether there is a
match to the group's regular expression in the specified field of the
entry. So, to add an entry to a group, you must simply make sure this
is the case.

<p>Instead of editing the field manually, you can select the entries
  you wish to add, and right-click to bring up the context menu. In
  the menu choose <em>Add to group</em> and then the correct group,
  and the entries not already in the group will be edited for you.

<H2>Removing entries from a group</H2>

<p>The same principle as for adding entries applies to removing
them. Remove any matches for the group's regular expression from the
specified field, or use the <em>Remove from group</em> function.

<H2>Removing a group</H2>

<p>To remove a group, right-click it and choose <em>Remove</em>. You will
be asked to confirm this action.
