<H1>Mark entries</H1>

You have the option of <em>marking</em> entries. Keyboard shortcuts are CTRL-M and CTRL-SHIFT-M to
mark and unmark the selected entries, respectively, and you can also access these actions in the
menus.

<p>Note that marking is not the same as selecting enties. The effects of marking entries are fairly
simple: All marked entries are distinguished by a yellow colour in the entry table, and always appear
above non-marked entries. Saving your database will preserve the markings.

<p>Marking entries can be useful for instance if you need to do several searches without losing your first
  search results, or if you need to remember which articles or books to look more closely at.
