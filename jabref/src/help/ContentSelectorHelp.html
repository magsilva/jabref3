    <h1>Field content selector</h1>

	This feature allows you to store a selection of often-used
	words or phrases that use use often in your
	database. Currently (JabRef 1.19) it is enabled for the fields
	<em>Journal</em>, <em>Keywords</em> and <em>Publisher</em>, but it
	will in future versions be possible to add selectors to other fields.
	<P>
	The word selection is database-specific, and is saved along
	with your references in the .bib file.
	<P>
	To add a new word, you can simply write it into the selector
	combo box and press Enter. Using the <em>Manage</em> dialog
	you can also remove words that you have added.
