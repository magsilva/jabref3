<H1>Fetching Medline entries</H1>

JabRef can download citations from the Medline database, given the Medline IDs for the articles. You must
already have obtained the IDs, e.g. from a database search on the web.

<P>To use this feature, simply choose <b>Tools -> Fetch Medline</b>, and the Medline interface will
appear in the side pane. You can enter one or several IDs in the text field - if more than one ID
is entered, separate the numbers by semicolon (;) or comma (,). Press enter or the <b>Fetch</b> button.
