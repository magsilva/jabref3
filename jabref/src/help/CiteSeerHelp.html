<H2>Importing An Entry From CiteSeer</H2>

JabRef can download information about a particular citation from the CiteSeer database.
To start this process, add a new entry into your database and populate the URL field with
a link to its content page on CiteSeer.  The URL field must have the following format:

<p>http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/DDDDDD.html

<p>where DDDDD is a sequence of digits.  To find the DDDD sequence for a CiteSeer entry,
goto the citation's document page of the format http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/<i>nameYearTitle</i>.html
and click on the (Update) link for this citation.  The URL for the Update link will contain the numeric
ID for this citation.

<p>Once you have populated the URL field, you may download the CiteSeer fields by selecting
 <b>BibTex -> Import CiteSeer data</b>.  Make sure you have selected the row you wish to 
 update.
