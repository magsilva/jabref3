<H1>Customizing the BibTeX key generator</H1>

In the 'Key pattern' tab in Preferences, one can set the fields used in auto
generation of BibTex labels. The pattern can be set for each of the standard entry
types.
<P>
The pattern can contain any text you wish, in addition to field
markers that indicate that a specific field of the entry should be
inserted at that position of the key. A field marker generally
consists of the field name enclosed in square braces,
e.g. <b>[volume]</b>. If the field is undefined in an entry at the
time of key generation, no text will be inserted by the field marker.
<P>
Several special field markers are offered, which extract only a specific part of a field. These are listed below. Feel free to suggest new special field markers.

<P>
Special field markers:
<ul>
<li><b>[<code>auth</code>]</b>: The last name of the first author<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authors</code>]</b>: The last name of all authors<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authorIni</code>]</b>: The first 5 characters of the first author's last name,
          and the last name initials of the remaining authors.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authN</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the first author's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>authN_M</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the Mth author's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>auth.auth.ea</code>]</b>: The last name of the first two authors, and ".ea" if there are more than two.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtr</code>]</b>: The last name of the first editor<BR>
<li><b>[<code>editors</code>]</b>: The last name of all editors<BR>
<li><b>[<code>editorIni</code>]</b>: The first 5 characters of the first editor's last name,
 	and the last name initials of the remaining editors.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtrN</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the first editor's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtrN_M</code>]</b>: The first N characters of the Mth editor's last name<BR>
<li><b>[<code>edtr.edtr.ea</code>]</b>: The last name of the first two editors, and ".ea" if there are more than two.<BR>
<li><b>[<code>firstpage</code>]</b>: The number of the first page of the publication<BR>
<li><b>[<code>lastpage</code>]</b>: The number of the last page of the publication<BR>
<li><b>[<code>shorttitle</code>]</b>: The first 3 words of the title<BR>
<li><b>[<code>shortyear</code>]</b>: The last 2 digits of the publication year<BR>
<li><b>[<code>veryshorttitle</code>]</b>: The first word of the title,
discounting 'the', 'a', 'an'.<BR>
 </ul>

<P>
A field name (or one of the above pseudo-field names) may optionally
be followed by a modifier. Currently the only defined modifier is
<b>:lower</b>, which forces the text inserted by the field marker to
be in lowercase.  For example, <b>[auth:lower]</b> expands the last
name of the first author in lowercase.

<P>
The default key pattern is [auth][year], and this could produce
keys like e.g. <code>Yared1998</code> If the key is not unique in the
current database, it is made unique by adding one of the letters a-z
until a unique key is found. Thus, the labels might look like:
<blockquote> <code>Yared1998</code><BR> <code>Yared1998a</code><BR>
<code>Yared1998b</code> </blockquote>
