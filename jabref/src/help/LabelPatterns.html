<H1>Customizing the BibTeX key generator</H1>

In the 'Key pattern' tab in Preferences, one can set the fields used in auto
generation of BibTex labels. The pattern can be set for each of the standard entry
types.
<P>
The pattern can contain any text you wish, in addition to field
markers that indicate that a specific field of the entry should be
inserted at that position of the key. A field marker generally
consists of the field name enclosed in square braces,
e.g. <b>[volume]</b>. If the field is undefined in an entry at the
time of key generation, no text will be inserted by the field marker.
<P>
Several special field markers are offered, which extract only a specific part of a field. These are listed below. Feel free to suggest new special field markers.

<P>
Special field markers:
<ul>
<li><b>[auth]</b>: The last name of the first author<BR>
<li><b>[authors]</b>: The last name of all authors<BR>
<li><b>[edtr]</b>: The last name of the first editor<BR>
<li><b>[editors]</b>: The last name of all editors<BR>
<li><b>[firstpage]</b>: The number of the first page of the publication<BR>
<li><b>[lastpage]</b>: The number of the last page of the publication<BR>
<li><b>[shorttitle]</b>: The first 3 words of the title<BR>
</ul>

<P>
The default key pattern is [auth][year], and this could produce
keys like e.g. <code>Yared1998</code> If the key is not unique in the
current database, it is made unique by adding one of the letters a-z
until a unique key is found. Thus, the labels might look like:
<blockquote> <code>Yared1998</code><BR> <code>Yared1998a</code><BR>
<code>Yared1998b</code> </blockquote>
