<H1>Custom export filters</H1>

JabRef allows you to define and use your own export filters, in the same way as the
standard export filters are defined. An export filter is defined by one or more
<i>layout files</i>, which with the help of a collection of built-in formatter
routines specify the format of the exported files. Your layout files must be prepared
in a text editor outside of JabRef.

<H2>Adding a custom export filter</H2>

The only requirement for a valid export filter is the existence of a file with
the extension <b>.layout</b>. To add a new custom export filter, open the
dialog box <b>Options -> Manage custom exports</b>, and click <b>Add new</b>.
A new dialog box will appear, allowing you to specify a name for the export filter
(which will appear in the <b>File -> Custom export</b> menu of the JabRef window),
the path to the <b>.layout</b> file, and the preferred file extension for the export
filter (which will be the suggested extension in the file dialog when you use the
export filter).

<H2>Creating the export filter</H2>

Let us assume that we are creating an HTML export filter.

<P>While the export filter only needs to consist of a single <b>.layout</b> file, which in this case
could be called <i>html.layout</i>, you may also want to add two files called
<i>html.begin.layout</i> and <i>html.end.layout</i>. The former contains the header part
of the output, and the latter the footer part. JabRef will look for these two files whenever
the export filter is used, and if found, either of these will be copied verbatim to the output
before or after the individual entries are written.

<P>Note that these files must reside in the same directory as <i>html.layout</i>, and must be
named by inserting <b>.begin</b> and <b>.end</b>, respectively.

<P>In our example export filter, these could look like the following:

<p><i>html.begin.layout</i>:<br>
<code>&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
  &lt;BODY&gt; text="#275856"&gt;<br>
&lt;basefont size="4" color="#2F4958" face="arial"&gt;</code>

<p><i>html.end.layout</i>:<br>
<code>&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
  &lt;/HTML&gt;</code>

<P>The file <i>html.layout</i> provides the <i>default</i> template for exporting entries. If
you want to use different templates for different entry types, you can do this by adding entry-specific
<b>.layout</b> files. These must also reside in the same directory as the main layout file, and
are named by inserting <b>.entrytype</b> into the name of the main layout file. The entry type name
must be in all lowercase. In our example, we might want to add a template for book entries, and this
would go into the file <i>html.book.layout</i>. For a PhD thesis we would add the file
<i>html.phdthesis.layout</i>, and so on. These files are similar to the default layout file, except that
they will only be used for entries of the matching type. Note that the default file can easily be made
general enough to cover most entry types in most export filters.
