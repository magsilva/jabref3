<H1>Searching in Bibkeeper</H1>

<em>CTRL-F</em> opens the search dialog.</em>

<P>You enter your search string into the text field in the search
dialog, and press enter or click "Search". The <em>Settings</em>
button opens a menu showing the settings for your search. Settings
include limiting which fields are searched, deciding whether your
search string should be interpreted as a regular expression, and
deciding whether the search should be case-sensitive.

<P>Once the search finishes, the entry table in the main window will
change to show the results. Entries are sorted according to search
score (you can see the score if you have checked the "Search" field in
the Preferences dialog), and any entry in which the search string was
not found, will be grayed out. The table changes to its normal state
once you close the search dialog.

<p>While a search is active, it will only display hits contained in
your currently shown <em>group</em>. Searching and displaying groups
are separate actions, and the table will always display the appropriate
subset of entries decided by your active search and/or group.

<p>You can at any time export a <em>bibtex</em> database containing
only the entries in your currently shown group and/or search, by
choosing <em>File -> Save special</em> in the menu.
