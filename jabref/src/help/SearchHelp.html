<H1>Searching in JabRef</H1>

There are three different search modes in JabRef.

<p>
<em>CTRL-F</em> opens or focuses the search interface. Pressing
<em>CTRL-F</em> several times toggles search mode. When searching
incrementally, pressing <em>CTRL-F</em> makes the program search for
the next occurence of the search string.
<p>
<em>CTRL-SHIFT-F</em> opens or focuses the search interface, and
selects incremental search. When searching incrementally,
<em>CTRL-SHIFT-F</em> also finds the next occurence of the search
string.

<H2>Incremental search</H2>

When searching incrementally, the program searches immediately each
time you press a letter. The status line informs you about the success
of the search. Pressing the search shortcut keys causes the program to
find the next occurence of the current search string. If no further
occurences can be found, the status line will notify you about
this. Repeating the search again causes the search to restart at the
top. The search order always follows the current sorting of your
database. To escape an incremental search, press ESC or click "Clear
search".

<H2>Highlight search</H2>

In highlight search, the program searches your database for all occurences of your search string, once you press ENTER. All entries that match, are selected.

<H2>Float search</H2>

Float search is similar to highlight search, except that the entries
that match will not be selected, but instead will be moved to the top
of the table. Entries which do not match will end up below the ones
that do, and in addition will be displayed in gray. To stop displaying
the search results, press ESC or click "Clear search".

<H2>Search settings</H2>

 The <em>Settings</em> button opens a menu showing the settings for
 your search. Settings include limiting which fields are searched,
 deciding whether your search string should be interpreted as a
 regular expression, and deciding whether the search should be
 case-sensitive.

<!--
<p>You can at any time export a <em>bibtex</em> database containing
only the entries in your currently shown group and/or search, by
choosing <em>File -> Save special</em> in the menu. -->
