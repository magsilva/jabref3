<h2>Standard Fields</h2>





<p>
Below is a description of all fields
recognized by the standard bibliography styles.
An entry can also contain other fields, which are ignored by those styles.
</p>




<dl>




<dt><strong>address</strong>
</dt><dd>
Usually the address of the <tt>publisher</tt> or other type
of institution.
For major publishing houses,
van&nbsp;Leunen recommends omitting the information entirely.
For small publishers, on the other hand, you can help the
reader by giving the complete address.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>annote</strong>
</dt><dd>
An annotation.
It is not used by the standard bibliography styles,
but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>author</strong>
</dt><dd>
The name(s) of the author(s),
in the format described in the LaTeX book.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>booktitle</strong>
</dt><dd>
Title of a book, part of which is being cited.
See the LaTeX book for how to type titles.
For book entries, use the <tt>title</tt> field instead.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>chapter</strong>
</dt><dd>
A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>crossref</strong>
</dt><dd>
The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>edition</strong>
</dt><dd>
The edition of a book--for example, ``Second''.
This should be an ordinal, and
should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here;
the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>editor</strong>
</dt><dd>
Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book.
If there is also an <tt>author</tt> field, then
the <tt>editor</tt> field gives the editor of the book or collection
in which the reference appears.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>howpublished</strong>
</dt><dd>
How something strange has been published.
The first word should be capitalized.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>institution</strong>
</dt><dd>
The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>journal</strong>
</dt><dd>
A journal name.
Abbreviations are provided for many journals; see the <i>Local Guide</i>.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>key</strong>
</dt><dd>
Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when
the ``author'' information is missing.
This field should not be confused with the key that appears in the
<code>\cite</code> command and at the beginning of the database entry.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>month</strong>
</dt><dd>
The month in which the work was
published or, for an unpublished work, in which it was written.
You should use the standard three-letter abbreviation,
as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LaTeX book.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>note</strong>
</dt><dd>
Any additional information that can help the reader.
The first word should be capitalized.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>number</strong>
</dt><dd>
The number of a journal, magazine, technical report,
or of a work in a series.
An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
identified by its volume and number;
the organization that issues a
technical report usually gives it a number;
and sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>organization</strong>
</dt><dd>
The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a manual.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>pages</strong>
</dt><dd>
One or more page numbers or range of numbers,
such as <tt>42-111</tt> or <tt>7,41,73-97</tt> or <tt>43+</tt>
(the `<tt>+</tt>' in this last example indicates pages following
that don't form a simple range).
To make it easier to maintain <em>Scribe</em>-compatible databases,
the standard styles convert a single dash (as in <tt>7-33</tt>)
to the double dash used in TeX to denote number ranges
(as in <tt>7-33</tt>).
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>publisher</strong>
</dt><dd>
The publisher's name.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>school</strong>
</dt><dd>
The name of the school where a thesis was written.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>series</strong>
</dt><dd>
The name of a series or set of books.
When citing an entire book, the the <tt>title</tt> field
gives its title and an optional <tt>series</tt> field gives the
name of a series or multi-volume set
in which the book is published.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>title</strong>
</dt><dd>
The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>type</strong>
</dt><dd>
The type of a technical report--for example,
``Research Note''.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>volume</strong>
</dt><dd>
The volume of a journal or multivolume book.
<p>
</p></dd><dt><strong>year</strong>
</dt><dd>
The year of publication or, for
an unpublished work, the year it was written.
Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as <tt>1984</tt>,
although the standard styles can handle any <tt>year</tt> whose
last four nonpunctuation characters are numerals,
such as `(about 1984)'.</dd>
