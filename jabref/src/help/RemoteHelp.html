<H1>Remote operation</H1>

This feature can be toggled and configured under <b>Preferences -> Advanced</b>.

<p>If listening for remote operation is enabled, JabRef will at startup attempt to start listening
to a specific port. This means that other applications can send information to JabRef through
this port.
<p>
It also means that a second JabRef instance will notice that the first one is running, because
    the port is busy. In this case, unless specifically instructed to run in stand-alone mode,
    the second JabRef instance will pass its command line options through the port to the first
    JabRef instance, and then immediately quit.

<p>The first JabRef instance will read the command line options, and perform the indicated actions,
    such as reading or importing a file, or importing a file to the currently shown database.
