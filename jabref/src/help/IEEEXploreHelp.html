<H1>Search IEEEXplore</H1>

JabRef can download citations from the IEEEXplore database.
To use this feature, choose <b>Web search -> Search IEEEXplore</b>,
and the search interface will appear in the side pane.
<P>
To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press
<b>Enter</b> or the <b>Fetch</b> button.

<p>
The search is done in guest mode, which means that a maximum of 100 results
will be returned.

<p>
You may opt to download the abstracts along with the cite information for each
entry, by checking the <b>Include abstracts</b> checkbox. This causes a
significantly larger amount of network queries, so to avoid excessive pressure
on the IEEEXplore web site, JabRef will refuse to download abstracts
for searches returning more than a given number of hits.
