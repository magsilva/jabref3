<H1>Command line options</H1>

Although JabRef is primarily a GUI based application, it offers several command line options
that may be useful, and can even perform file conversion operations without opening the graphical
interface.

<P>You can always specify one or more BibTeX files to load by simply listing their filenames. If you want
  to immediately export a BibTeX file from the command line, you are adviced to load it using the <code>-i</code>
  option, to ensure that your command line is processed correctly.

<H2>Help: -h</H2>

This option causes JabRef to display a summary of the command line options, and quit immediately.

<H2>No-GUI mode: -n</H2>

This option suppresses both the JabRef window and the splash window normally shown at startup. It
causes the program to quit immediately once the command line options have been processed.
<P>This option is useful for performing file conversion operations from the command line or a script.

<H2>Load session: -l</H2>

This option causes JabRef to load the saved session, if any, before opening the main window.

<H2>Import file: -i filename[,format]</H2>

This option causes JabRef to import or load the specified file. If only a filename is specified, it will
be loaded as a BibTeX file. If the filename is followed by a comma and an import format, the given import
filter will be used. Use the <code>-h</code> option to get a list of availiable import formats.

<P>If an output option is also specified, an import will always be processed before it, and the imported or
  loaded file will be given to the export filter. If the GUI is not suppressed using the <code>-n</code> option,
  any imported or loaded file will show up in the main window.

<H2>Export file: -o filename[,format]</H2>

This option causes JabRef to save or export a file imported using the <code>-i</code> option. If only a filename
is specified, it will be saved in BibTeX format. If the filename is followed by a comma and an export format,
the given export filter will be used. A custom export filter can be used in this way, and will be preferred if
the export name matches both a custom and a standard export filter.
<P>Use the <code>-h</code> option to get a list of availiable export formats.

<P>If the <code>-n</code> option has not been invoked, any export operation will be performed before the JabRef
  window is opened, and the imported database will show up in the window.
