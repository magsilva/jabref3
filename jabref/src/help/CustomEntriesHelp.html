    <h1>Customizing entry types</h1>
    <p>
    When customizing an entry type, you both define how its entry editor should look, and what
    it takes for JabRef to consider an entry complete. You can both make changes to the existing
    entry types, and define new ones.
    <p>
    <h2>Using the entry customization dialog</h2> 

In the dialog's upper left is a combo box where you can select one of
the current entry types.  All custom types, either new types or
redefined standard ones, are displayed with an asterisk (*) behind
their names.

<p>Selecting an entry type merely updates the dialog to show its set
of required and optional fields, to give you a template for
customization. You can then proceed to change both the definition and
the name of the entry type before storing. If the name written in the
<em>Name</em> text field is different from the selected item in the
combo box, the <em>Name</em> field takes precedence when you click
<em>Store</em> or <em>Delete</em>

<p>You can delete a customized entry type by selecting it and clicking
the <em>Delete</em> button; if the deleted definition redefined a
standard type, the standard definition will be restored. You are not
allowed to delete standard entry types.

<p>Note that there is no undo when creating, changing and deleting
entry type definitions.

<p>When selecting one of the standard types from the combo box, the
syntax for defining required and optional fields should become
obvious; the field names are simply written in your preferred order,
separated by semicolons. Either of the <em>Required fields</em> and
<em>Optional fields</em> text boxes can be empty, if no fields fit
into the category. The fields listed do not have to be standard fields
known by JabRef.

<h2>Redefining standard entry types</h2>
    
If you store an entry definition with an identical name to one of the
standard types, the custom type will override the standard one. You
can use this to redefine the order in which fields appear in the editor,
add new fields that you use, remove fields you have no interest in, and
even move all fields into the <em>Required fields</em> panel to avoid having
to switch when editing entries.

There is one limitation to customizing entry types; certain types have
an and/or condition in their required fields. For instance, a <em>book</em>
entry is complete with either the <em>author</em> or the <em>editor</em>
field, or both. This type of condition cannot be represented in a customized
entry.

If you delete a customized version of a standard entry type, the standard 
definition will be reinstated.
