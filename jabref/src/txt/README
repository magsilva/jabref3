Introduction: 

JabRef is a graphical Java application for editing bibtex (.bib)

JabRef lets you organize your entries into overlapping logical groups,
and with a single click limit your view to a single group or an
intersection or union of several groups. You can customize the entry
information shown in the main window, and sort by any of the standard
Bibtex fields. JabRef can autogenerate bibtex keys for your
entries, and autocomplete words or names in the field types of your
choosing. Most operations can be done without using the mouse.
