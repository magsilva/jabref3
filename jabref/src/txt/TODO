Chris:
------
  * Think about synchronizing XMP.
  * Document data schema used (BibteXmp)
  * Add build.xml target to export standalone XMPUtil for the CLI.
  * Plugin-Architecture for LayoutFormatters.
  * Allow search relativ to bibtex-file
  
Morten:
* See if the old Bibkeeper autocomplete stuff is still in there
   somewhere, and if it is still usable
