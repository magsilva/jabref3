------
  * Think about synchronizing XMP.
  * Document data schema used (BibteXmp)
  * Add build.xml target to export standalone XMPUtil for the CLI.
  * Allow search relativ to bibtex-file
  * Plugin-System may crash...
  
Morten:

* Documentation export formatters

* Enable "Open spires entry" ("openSpires" action)? Think about better integration of this?
  Look into which viewer is used.
* Merge patch for entry types (see patch for IEEEXploreFetcher)
* [OK?] Improve duplicate check.
* Add "Copy all externally linked files for this set of entries"-feature.
  Basic functionality in AccessLinksForEntries.
* Problem setting today with Microba calendar.

* [MADE WORKAROUND] Native FileDialog does not work for selecting a directory.
  - workaround is to autodisable native file dialog for dir selection.

* [OK? Extension fields only] MODS exports "file" in raw form.
* [POSTPONE] Icon selection for external file types: - select arbitrary images from disk?
* [POSTPONE] Fix Save/Export file dialog stuff
* [POSTPONE] Look up Vista problem with opening file chooser:
    Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
