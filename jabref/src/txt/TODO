  * Think about synchronizing XMP.
  * Document data schema used (BibteXmp)
  * Add build.xml target to export standalone XMPUtil for the CLI.
  * Allow search relativ to bibtex-file
  * Plugin-System may crash...

* [POSTPONE] Strange bug: when editing a field in entry editor, then clicking an entry of different type
   in the table, current entry is stored, but the selection drops back to the first entry.
* [MADE WORKAROUND] Native FileDialog does not work for selecting a directory.
  - workaround is to autodisable native file dialog for dir selection.

* [DONE?] Usability of FileListEditor. Paste functionality.
* [OK? Extension fields only] MODS exports "file" in raw form.

* [POSTPONE] Look into "DOS short path" bug report.
* [POSTPONE] Problem setting today with Microba calendar.
* [POSTPONE] Icon selection for external file types: - select arbitrary images from disk?
