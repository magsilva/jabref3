JabRef Installer Documentation
------------------------------

How to build the installer:

  * Create a build.properties file in root-directory and set the
    nsis.executable variable to point to makensis.exe
  * Run the win.installer.build target from the ant-file in root-directory.

What is here?

  * dist
    * Should contain everything that is supposed to be shipped to the user.
    * Run target win.installer.prepare to let this be created and filled.
  * launcher.nsi - Will create the exe-wrapper.
  * setup.nsi - Will create the installer.
  * fileassoc.nsh - Helper script to set file-associations
