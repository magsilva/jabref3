<H1>File links in JabRef</H1>

JabRef lets you link up your entries with files of any type stored on your system, as well as
links to the document on the web in the form of an URL or a DOI identifier. Each entry can
have an arbitrary number of file links, and each linked file can be opened quickly from
JabRef.
<p>
In BibTeX terms, the file links of an entry are encoded in a single field. However, from
within JabRef they appear as an editable list of links accessed from the entry editor
along with other BibTeX fields.

<H2>Setting up external file types</H2>

For each file link, a file type must be chosen, to determine what icon should be used and what
application should be called to open the file. The list of file types can be viewed and edited
by choosing <b>Options -> Manage external file types</b>, or by clicking the <b>Manage external
file types</b> button in the <b>External programs</b> tab of the Preferences dialog.
<p>
A file type is specified by its name, a graphical icon, a file extension and an application to view the files. On Windows, the name of the application can be omitted in
order to use Window's default viewer instead.

<h2>Adding external links to an entry</h2>

If the "file" field is included in <a href="GeneralFields.html">General fields</a>,
you can edit the list of external links for an entry in the <a href="EntryEditorHelp.html">Entry editor</a>. The editor includes buttons for inserting,
editing and removing links, as well as buttons for reordering the list of links.
<p>
If you have a file within or below your file directory (set up in <b>Preferences -> External programs -> External file links -> Main file directory</b>) with an extension
matching one of the defined external file types, and a name containing a BibTeX entry's
BibTeX key, the file can be autolinked by clicking on the <b>Auto</b> button in the entry editor. The rules for which file names can be autolinked to a BibTeX key can be set up in
<b>Preferences -> External programs -> External file links -> Use regular expression search</b>.
<p>
If you want to download a file and link to it from a BibTeX entry, you can do this by
clicking the <b>Download</b> button in the entry editor. A dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter the URL. The file will be downloaded to your main file directory,  named based on the entry's BibTeX key, and finally linked from the entry.

<h2>Opening external files</h2>

There are several ways to open an external file or web page. In the entry table you can select an entry and use the menu choice, keyboard shortcut
or the right-click menu to open an entry's first external link. Alternatively, if the entry table is set up to show the <b>file</b> column (set up in <b>Preferences -> Entry table -> Special table columns -> Show file column</b>), you can click on
the file icon to open an entry's first link. To access any of an entry's links, click
on the icon with the right mouse button (or <b>Ctrl-click</b> on Max OS X) to bring up
a menu showing all links.
